    <p>Hi friends, You can call me Hilarious Hacker. I'm gonna explain my methods.<br>
        First things first, Collecting information via a fake website is called phishing and is the easiest way in password cracking. I bet you know I used phishing hack against you. Here is how:
        <ol>
            <li><span class="h">Email Spoofing:</span><br>Sending of E-mails from any email ID without the need to access the password is called as Email Spoofing.
For this I created my own server and had it deployed.You can use it by visiting the below link:<br><br><a href="http://smailer.000webhostapp.com/sendmail.php"><ul><li> Email Spoofer</ul></a><br><span class="h">Usage Instructions:</span>
<ul>
    <li>In the Sender Name, Enter any fake Name.</li>
    <li>In the Sender Email, Enter any valid Email ID.</li>
    <li>In the Receiver Email, Enter who you want to send the email to</li>
    <li>In the Subject, Enter the subject of the Email</li>
    <li>In the Message Part, Enter your message in HTML format (only plane text also accepted).</li>
    <li>In the Verification Code type in the number displayed in the Image</li>
    <li>Press the submit button</li>
    <li><span class="h">Limited to Only 50 Emails/perday</span></li>
</ul></li><br>
<li>
    <span class="h">Phishing Website:</span><br>You all would already be familiar with the E-xams website. I made you enter your details which were all mailed to one specific email id. All the emails were downloaded, parsed and your data was extracted which is displayed in the database. Out of 1050 responses, I got only 800 valid Emails. I believe the rest of them are swear words which I don't care about. Link to E-xams website and database are given below:<br><br>
    <a href="https://hilarious-hacker.github.io/E-xams/index.html"><ul><li>E-xams Website</li></ul></a>
    <br><span class="h">For my anonymity, I've removed the Emailing part. Thus the above website is completely safe now and none of your info would be sent to me.</span>
</li>
<br>
<li>
    <a href="https://hilarious-hacker.github.io/E-xams/dbindex.html">DataBase Link</a>
</li>
<br>
            <li> <span class="h">My Account Data:</span><br><b>Gmail Account:</b> captainprabakar126@gmail.com,<br><b>Gmail Password:</b> Sunday 8 PM IST<br>
                <b>Instagram Account:</b>rec_databreach_hacker,<br><b>Password:</b> Sunday 8 PM IST<br><br>
                <br> <b>The above information is correct. If you can't login, someone else might have changed the password. Don't change the password of any account. Let everyone be able to use it.</b>
                <ol>
<br><br></p>
<div>
    <b style="color:red">How to escape these type of attacks ?</b> 
    <ul>
        <li>Always check the Profile Image. If any kind of caution symbol is displayed, it is most likely forged.</li>
        <li>Ask your college to add SPF record to their domain server for staff and management alone.</li>
        <li>Check the source of Email</li>
        <li><b>And for Goddamn Sake Don't have same passwords for Gmail, Instagram and anonymous sites. I literally had access to over 200 out of 800 Instagram Accounts with the passwords you gave me</li>
        </b></ul>

     everyone knows how I did it and everyone has the database.<br>2.> Thus my anonymity is conserved-!<br>
